        <p>Hi! I'm Katie Dinh, a third year engineering student majoring in Computer Science at UCLA.
        I'm very excited to begin applying my knowledge to real-world instances, and always looking for new
        projects to sharpen my skills. My interests are in software engineering and video game design.

            <h3>Christmas Spirits -- ACM Studio Snow Jam</h3>
            <p>
                This was a 2-week project to build a video game with the theme "On Ice." I was a programmer in a 
                team of 6, and we chose a Christmas bar game as a play on words! I was responsible for the core filling drinks mechanic,
                general UI, and importing the writers' and artists' work. This was super fun, and although we did not include
                everything we wanted to, I got more practice with Unity, C#, and problem solving.

            <h3>Axolotl Luncheonette -- ACM Studio Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                This was a 3-day project and my first ever game jam. The theme was "You have only one __," and my team
                of 4 decided on a restaurant-type food serving game. I implemented the customer spawning and order processing as well as general UI.
                I learned a lot about Unity, C#, and keeping designs in scope in such a short timeframe.

            <h3>Mushi Wars</h3>
            <p>
                This was a solo personal board game project based on concepts from a friend! The goal is to protect your Hero using your allies
                and fun card effects whilst trying to attack the enemy Hero. It is a playable two-player game made in Unity, C#, and PhotonNetwork.

            <h3>Star Death</h3>
            <p>
                I was one of the writers for murder mystery visual novel Star Death! I worked closely with the other writers as well as artists,
                music, and programmers to create a cohesive and mysterious beginning of a royal story. The demo was released in a 3 month timeframe in Winter 2024!
