        <h1>Katie Dinh</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Katie Dinh, a third year engineering student majoring in Computer Science at UCLA.
        I'm very excited to begin applying my knowledge to real-world instances, and always looking for new
        projects to sharpen my skills. My interests are in software engineering and video game design.
        </p>

            <h3>Scotland!</h3>
            <p>
                This past summer I traveled to Scotland as part of the UCEAP Summer Physics Program at the University of Glasgow.
                One of my main reasons for going was to fulfill academic requirements, but also the opportunity to live and learn in a completely new country. 
                Being abroad gave me the chance to experience a different culture through sightseeing, meeting new people, and forming new friendships with my class peers. 
                I was especially interested in seeing how education and academic philosophy differed from what I was used to, and I learned about
                their emphasis on group-based learning and helping each other figure out problems instead of being told directly what the answer was.
            </p>

            <h3 id="AskMargot">Ask Margot</h3>
            <p> 
                Ask Margot was my team's assigned company during the Studio phase of Break Through Tech AI!
                Over 4 months, our group and TA worked together to design an AI model in Python that could match travel nurses
                to their preferred hospitals when looking for work. We experimented with filtering, NLP, supervised learning, and 
                sentiment analysis to improve match relevance. We dealt with problems such as a cold start and
                initial matching, and considering a combination of filtering methods instead of just one. This project helped apply
                my learning from the first half of BTT into something tangible whilst working in a team and meeting regularly with our company representative!

            <h3>MERN Stack Group Finder Project</h3>
            <p>
                This project involved building a full-stack group-finding web app for students using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). 
                For the website, I helped create profiles, authenticate securely, and send requests to connect based on shared interests. I worked closely with a 4-person team using GitHub for 
                version control and collaboration, which helped us maintain code quality and efficiently track bugs and feature updates throughout development, as well
                as rollback if we needed to.

            <h3>Break Through Tech AI (BTT)</h3>
            <p>
                In the first half of this program, I learned the fundamentals of AI/ML and practiced
                building and training regression and neural network models using Python. I was selected from over 3,000 applicants to participate in the Break Through Tech AI Program at UCLA, 
                an experience that combined hands-on ML coursework taught by Cornell faculty with real-world projects <a href="#AskMargot">(Ask Margot)</a> and mentorship from industry professionals. 
                This provided my foundation on AI/ML and my understanding of how ML is applied in industry. I received an eCornell certificate for finishing the course.
            </p>

            <h3>BruinTour -- CS32 Final Project</h3>
            <p>
                This was a program that plans the best tour route around special points of interest using real map data. 
                I used the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between points of interest and generated clear step-by-step instructions, 
                like when to turn or what to say at each stop. I got hands-on experience parsing large datasets from OpenStreetMap, working with geographic coordinates, building data structures to manage location info,
                as well as practical experience with C++ and debugging code.

            <h3>AAA Auto Club Enterprises</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first real experience into a company just before my senior year of high school. 
                I rotated through several departments, including automation, Agile development, and cybersecurity, which gave me a broad look at how different teams operate. 
                I spent time shadowing senior employees and sitting in on meetings to better understand their day-to-day work, 
                and the experience helped me build meaningful connections with mentors and peers.
